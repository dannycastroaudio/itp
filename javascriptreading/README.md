### Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators

**What I already knew:**

I already knew about the basic data types described in this chapter. They have remained pretty much the same in each programming language I have encountered. The data types are the following:

* Numbers

  * Integers `69`

  * Floats `6.9`
  
  * Special numbers 
     
	 * `NaN` (reading it makes me a little hungry)
	 * `Infinity`
	 * `-Infinity`

* Strings
  * ` "This is a string" `

* Booleans
  * `console.log("Garnet" == "Ruby")`
    
	  `// â†’ true`
	
	*(this is technically true because in [Steven Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe), [Garnet](https://steven-universe.fandom.com/wiki/Garnet) is actually a [fusion](https://steven-universe.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_Gems) between [Ruby](https://steven-universe.fandom.com/wiki/Ruby) and [Sapphire](https://steven-universe.fandom.com/wiki/Sapphire). Garnet is the personification of their eternal love. But I digress)*
	
* Undefined/Empty values
  * `null`
  * `undefined`
 
**What I did not know:** 

I loved how much information inn this text I didn't know about. This means i can look forward to a great lot of learning.

The homework is asking me for one thing, A difficult task. 

I had no idea how many operators there are in JavaScript. Sure, I've used some like `=`, `==` and `!=`, but there are so many!!! 

* Binary ops for arithmetic
  * `+`: addition
  * `-`: subtraction
  * `*`: multiplication
  * `/`: division
  * `%`: represents a remainder. divides X by Y.
* String concatenation (new fave word)
  * `+`
* String comparison with boolean logic
  * `==`: equal to
  * `!=`: not equal to
  * `===`(THIS IS TERNARY!!!): is the value precisely equal to the other value?
  * `!==`(ALSO TERNARYYYY!!!): is the value **not** precisely equal to the other value
  * `<`: less than
  * `>`: greater than
  * `<=`: less than or equal to
  * `>=`: greater than or equal to
* Logic based operators that can be applied to Boolean data types
  * `&&`: "and"
  * `||`: "or"
  * `??`: behaves like "or" but its based on the presence of null/undefined as the left value. If the left value is null or defined, the value on the right is returned. 
* Unary Operators
  * `-`: negates number
  * `!`: "not"
  * `typeof`: negates logically
* Another ternary operator
  * `?:`: picks one of two values all based on a third value

Also, the existence of unary, binary, and ternary operators. I kind of understand what they all mean compared to one another now.

### Chapter 2: Program Structure

**What I already knew:**

I was already very familiar with the `if` `else` statements, they are used all the time in C#, which is the language im most comfortable with. I also knew what a a binding was, but I knw them by the name of variables. Same difference. It is still weird seeing `let` instead of `var`. 

`While` and `do` were also familiar, although they tend to trip me up with the way the statements are formatted. 

**What I did not know:**

There were a bunch of statements I didnt know existed, or if I did, I just didnt know how they worked. For instance, `for` was a complete unknown. Even the way the syntax works is tricky for me. Excluding `while` and `do` forces me to think more, even if theyre doing the same thing/yield the exact same results. 

Finally, the statments `switch` and `case` I had read about somewhere on Stack OverFlow, but how they operated was a complete mystery. Silly, seeing as, to me, they're the most straight forward.

### Chapter 3: Functions

I felt rather stupid reading this chapter. Even with breaks, it was a lot of information and it eventually started tasting like a weird leftover gruel. Like a grey rice porridge thats been left on the counter for an indefinite amount of time... 

*shivers*

**What I already knew**

I knew about scopes already, how they're local and global, and how they affect the code in their respective environments.
Moreover, I knew the scope distinctions between `let`, `const`, and `var`. Although ultimately their scope depends on where exactly they're declared, I stick to `var` for global bindings, and use `let` and `const` locally (inside whatever environment they are located).

**What I did not know**

I didnt know functions could be expressed in so many different ways. The shorthand notation (declaration notation) for functions and recursions is all very new to me. In fact, I dont fully get it yet. my brain gets mad when I try to read recursive code, and the way the textbook shows growing functions was a big [huh](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mQ-9NPtsh0c) to me. 

So, in summary, most function-related information in this chapter left me baffled. Im still not quite sure I understand functions as values.
