#JavaScript Reading

###Chapter 1 

**What I already knew:**

I already knew about the basic data types described in this chapter. They have remained pretty much the same in each programming language I have encountered. The data types are the following:

* Numbers

  * Integers `69`

  * Floats `6.9`
  
  * Special numbers 
     
	 * `NaN` (reading it makes me a little hungry)
	 * `Infinity`
	 * `-Infinity`

* Strings
  * ` "This is a string" `

* Booleans
  * `console.log("Garnet" == "Ruby")`
    
	  `// â†’ true`
	
	*(this is actually true because in Steven Universe Garnet is actually a fusion between Ruby and Sapphire. Garnet is the personification of their eternal love. But I digress)*
	
* Undefined/Empty values
  * `null`
  * `undefined`
 
**What I did not know:** 

I loved how much information inn this text I didn't know about. This means i can look forward to a great lot of learning.

The homework is asking me for one thing, A difficult task. 

I had no idea how many operators there are in JavaScript. Sure, I've used some like `==` and `!=`, but there are so many!!! 

* Binary ops for arithmetic
  * `+`: addition
  * `-`: subtraction
  * `*`: multiplication
  * `/`: division
  * `%`: represents a remainder. divides X by Y.
* String concatenation (new fave word)
  * `+`
* String comparison with boolean logic
  * `==`: equal to
  * `!=`: not equal to
  * `===`(THIS IS TERNARY!!!): is the value precisely equal to the other value?
  * `!==`(ALSO TERNARYYYY!!!): is the value **not** precisely equal to the other value
  * `<`: less than
  * `>`: greater than
  * `<=`: less than or equal to
  * `>=`: greater than or equal to
* Logic based operators that can be applied to Boolean data types
  * `&&`: "and"
  * `||`: "or"
  * `??`: behaves like "or" but its based on the presence of null/undefined as the left value. If the left value is null or defined, the value on the right is returned. 
* Unary Operators
  * `-`: negates number
  * `!`: "not"
  * `typeof`: negates logically
* Another ternary operator
  * `?:`: picks one of two values all based on a third value

Also, the existence of unary, binary, and ternary operators. I kind of understand what they all mean compared to one another now.
