                        Hey!
                        I'm Danny Castro, a Sound Designer and Audio Programmer from Costa Rica, currently based in Boston. 
                        I focus heavily on narrative and immersive sound design, trying to tell a story of not only what a player sees 
                        on-screen, but of the rich world that surrounds the main plot. 
                    <br><br>
                        I think that I care way too much about sound, I definitely spend too much time thinking about it.
                    <br><br>
                        I also specialise in audio implementation, whether it be in-engine or using middleware. 
                        It is a role I deeply enjoy, it feels like putting a puzzle together! And man do I love a good puzzle.
                    <br><br>
                        In the recent years I have found myself working more and more as a technical sound designer than anything else.
                    
                    <br><br>
                        In my leisure time, I make plugins! I've found this skill to be very helpful in games, 
                    
                        and have made my fair share of custom reverb plugins for games I've worked on.
                    <br><br>
                    
                        Some titles I've worked on (or am working on) include Unchained: Tale of Enra, The Ski Lodge Murder, and Echoes of Memory, to mention some.
                    
                    
                        I am currently interning at Serious Point Games as a Technical Sound Designer, working on their upcoming title The Ski Lodge Murder! 
                    <br><br>
                        Nevertheless, I am always in search of new opportunities and projects, so don't be afraid to reach out!

                <h2>A little more about me</h2>
                <br>
                    <p>
                            I was born in San Jose, Costa Rica, and music has been a part of my life since I was born. 
                            My father is a percussionist, my mother a dancer (she denies it). Playing drums was always treated as an integral part of my culture.
                            I started playing piano at 3, on a toy piano my grandmother bought for me. I kept on playing piano my entire life, but I focused on percussion.
                        <br><br>
                            At 12, I enrolled in classical percussion courses at the University of Costa Rica. At 14, I got accepted into the National Music Conservatory of Costa Rica. 
                            At 19, I moved to the United States and began my studies at Berklee College of Music, where I'm currently double-majoring in Electronic Production and Design (EPD), 
                            and Game and Interactive Media Scoring (GAIMS). I am also minoring in Creative Coding, where I focus on developing plugins using juce and Csound, and doing a 
                            specialisation in Sound Design with a focus on audio implementation.
