## Making the "good outcome" website

This part was frankly very easy.
I started out watching this tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org, where I learnt all the basics of HTML. This included text basics, list types, adding images, adding links, adding downloadables, tables, forms and inputs, and semantic HTML. This was a 4 hour long course that caught me up to speed with how HTML works, in addition to the exercise we did in class with the fake band website. 

I started out following along with the course on a separate project, following everything exactly as the instructor said. About halfway through, I decided it would be more efficient to start out my website with what i had learnt so far, which was enough to set up an index page and an about page. I used very basic CSS to simply change the background, certain font colours (like those that would take you to the different sections of the website), and basically focused on a functional, very bare HTML webpage.
I made a home page, an about page, a "proyects" page, and a contact page. I only populated the home and about pages, but left the other 2 ready to be accessible. 

Making the other 2 pages went very similarly, as it was plain HTML with very minimal CSS. The only different was that I incorporated myu new knowledge on forms and inputs. Everything else was pretty much the same.

at this point I still didnt know how to host a server, so my forms didnt send me any messages if someone were to use them. Thats a problem for the future, I might not even use those and simply link my contact information. I just think it looks rather professional.




## CSS

a lot more complicated than i thought! as someone who's used canva or wix before, I did not know this is what went on under the hood.
I started by following this other CSS tutorial, also by freeCodeCamp.org. It was great, because it showed me all of the basics of CSS first, like selector types, typography, unit and size conversion, list styles, etc. Formatting text is onviously a lot easier than formatting images, like how I planned in my project proposal. 

Lots of my initial CSS was trial and failure, like seeing what kind of padding i liked most, or what adjusting the margin actually did (the isntructor later explained this in detail, but i was definitely flying blind in the beginning). 
I had learnt a little of CSS from our in-class exercise, I had been able to look over at what my teammate was doing and asked her a couple of questions, like "what is display: flex?". She was very vague but I saw that it worked and HOW it worked. Once the course had explained what flex was, and that it made moving things around a little easier, I added it to my website's CSS. 

Myn first big challenge, which is a little silly, was to get my navigation list to show up horizontal instead of vertical. I was using `display: inline-block`, but that didnt seem to move them at all. I went ahead and played with the margins, added a specific id, and did deleted and rewrote the whole section while trying to get it to move. Turns out, I had put my list items inside a paragarph per item, which overruled my CSS that was made specifically for lists and unordered lists. Once I had removed that `<p>` tags from the list, the `inline-block` code worked, and I was able to adjust it to my likiing with inline margins, padding, and fontsizes. But this isnt what I wanted to do ultimatelyt, I wanted each of those items to appear as images with a header or a little text below them that would take the user to said pages. I wasnt there in my course yet, there was still so much to learn. So I followed the course dilligently (partly because it was very interesting and I love learning) and continued to draw the assets on the side.

Then something terrible occurred!! I got sick. WHICH SUCKED because I had to spend liek 3 days in bed. This screwed up my entire work schedule, and I was a little behind. There was nothing I could do, I was so ill I could not get out of bed. My netflix became the CSS course, as it was 11 hours long and it was full of invaluable information.
