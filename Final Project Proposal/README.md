### Danny Castro
### LMSC-261-001

For my final project, I will use HTML5 to create my own portfolio website with fun and intertactive features that show my personality as a sound designer and audio professional.

As for how in the world I'm going to do this by learning essentialyl from scratch, I'm simpyl to be learning as I go, researching, and visiting important resources. Some of the resources I'll use for making my project are the following:

 - [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)'s HTML [Full Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE), taught by Dave Gray. This short 4 hour course will get me on track to being able to code a bsic website using HTML. 
 - DesignCourse's crash course on [Frontend Development with HTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl3nOXQjVnQ), and their crash course on [UI/UX design using Figma and HTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwSN4n2sjR8)(even though I am going to be doing everything with HTML, or translating from figma to HTML)
 - [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home)'s course on [UI Design with HTML and CSS](https://scrimba.com/learn-ui-design-c024), taught by Gary Simon
 - [codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)'s [HTML and CSS courses](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css?g_network=g&g_productchannel=&g_adid=777710299190&g_locinterest=&g_keyword=learn%20html&g_acctid=243-039-7011&g_adtype=&g_keywordid=kwd-14360861&g_ifcreative=&g_campaign=account&g_locphysical=9002059&g_adgroupid=165097892769&g_productid=&g_source={sourceid}&g_merchantid=&g_placement=&g_partition=&g_campaignid=21287608736&g_ifproduct=&utm_id=t_kwd-14360861:ag_165097892769:cp_21287608736:n_g:d_c&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid-search&utm_term=learn%20html&utm_campaign=US_-_Exact&utm_content=777710299190&g_adtype=search&g_acctid=243-039-7011&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21287608736&gbraid=0AAAAAon8KZFq80Y85mIvFi_Xp87-WZkG_&gclid=CjwKCAiAwqHIBhAEEiwAx9cTeXCtFkFDfB-oQwZpxtopBcOWiJAHXzh7uEQVF-yAf3Nez5b3HGNrshoCp-0QAvD_BwE), looking at lessons on a need-to-know basis.

I will be creating an interactive, very cute looking website to serve as my artist website! On it, I will have my portfolio, game credits, and other fun information people might want to knlow (like how to contact me). I would also love include links to all the games ive had the pleasure of working on/games im currently working on.
 
For a while I've been meaning to code my own website, I just have not been able to find the time due to my 2 jobs and soul-crushing workload. I know a little HTML, very basic, but I knew that I would have to take a course and something similar to actually do it. This class is giving me the excuse I needed to create my own website byu actually forcing me to do it in exchange of academic appraisal! yay! 
 
I know I could do it using [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) or whatever people use nowadays, but those websites have always felt pretty boring to me. Most websites created using applications dont really entice me to use their services/check out the artist's work. Unless it is very well designed, I will simply forget about it. Good websites stay with you, like [A Shell In The Pit](https://ashellinthepit.com)'s website. Theyre a contractor audio and music studio, and their's is my favourite websites and my main inspiration for personalising my own. Even if I dont finish every feature I want to have by the end of teh semester, I'll have a base from where to continue building and expanding! Hopefully I can be remembered as "that one sound designer with the really cool website".

Regarding the art that I want to include, I've been drawing my singles and album covers for a while, using a consistent aesthetic, so I have plenty of material to reference, grab from, and use as inspiration for new art. Im not a greast artist by any means, but I can make silly drawings, which is what has defined my "brand image" for the last couple of years.

I also want it to be audio interactive, so taht depending on what button/tab you click, a sound can play, or something with audio can happen. Its a great way to feature myself as much as possible and interconnect web development and my actual career.

This project is completely unrelated to other classes. I would say instead that this project will serve me for personal endeavors, and I hope that I can have this be my definitive artist website for many years to come.

## Good outcome for final project

 - Working website 
 - Displays my portfolio reel
 - Displays a short biography
 - Contains links to my socials and other platforms I use to share my work
 - Is not completely blank, maybe has some colour to it, even a solid background colour
 - Has headers and subheaders! Not just a wall of text is what im hoping
 
## Better outcome for final project
 - Website has different tabs, each one containing different bits of information (about, work, reel, contact, etc.)
 - Has visuals in the landing page/main page that go beyond a solid background colour, adding some of my own drawings as icons
 - Uses cool fonts! Anything other than the default font.

## Best outcome for final project

 - Has moving pictures/animations! Or maybe the icons float a litte
 - Buttons and icons emit sounds when you press them, making my website feel a little like a game
 - Every tab has its own design, with colourful images 
 - Has hand-drawn icons that lead you to different things (like game credits, youtube channel, instagram, etc...)
 - Instead of an existing font, it used a self-created font! That way it looks like i wrote it
 - Contains a silly self portrait of myself in the about section
 - The whole website, other than being very informative and easy to navigate, has a cohesive aesthetic that makes me and my work more attractive for potential customers/hiring teams

## Steps to complete this project (with dates) 

**Complete the following steps by the indicated dates**

 - 11 Nov 2025: Master basic HTML using the sources linked in this file 
 - 18 Nov 2025: Make basic website (probably just a landing page), meeting the requirements of "Good Outcome". Once website is complete, begin making drawings and assets for the "better outcome" version of the project. 
 - 25 Nov 2025: Make the "better outcome" website, make sure it contains at least different tabs, has some visuals, and uses a different font.
 - 2 Dec 2025: Research how to add moving pictures to HTML websites! Continue drawing more assets for other tabs that aren't the landing page. Make some sounds that will go with the website when you click on things. Research how to emit sounds in HTML when you click on objects. Make sure the website if fully functional as it is.
 - 9 Dec 2025: Final polishes, add all the assets, make sure the website aesthetic is cohesive, test all functionality, ask some friends to review it.
