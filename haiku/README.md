# Recording a Haiku using terminal!
## Danny Castro, LMSC-261-001
### My process

1. I opened up terminal and reviewed the temrinal commands (e.g. `man man`, `cd`, `pwd`, `say`, and the `-o` addition to save the file).

2. I located the homework folder inside my github using `cd` and dragging the folder in (I had already created it in class)

3. After this, I checked I was in the right place using `pwd`

4. I looked up a haiku that made me laugh, and entered it after the `say` command just to hear it

5. Satisfied, I saved my haiku using the following code:

``` 
say ""Your haiku are shit"
That's all you would say to me
As I crapped one out" -o haiku.aiff 
```

6. Took a screenshot of code 
7. uploaded Screenshot to folder called img inside the haiky homework folder
8. Copied image link from github and aded to this README.md file

### Debugging:

I forgot how to name the file at first, so my first attempt ended up being called aiff.aiff

This was the code I had entered

``` 
say ""Your haiku are shit"
That's all you would say to me
As I crapped one out" -o aiff 
```

Following this, I checked my notes and the class [github](https://github.com/rdwrome/261fa25) and saw I had name it using this code

```
-o name.aiff
```

With my code now fixed (aka adding the name.aiff), I deleted the aiff.aiff file.
