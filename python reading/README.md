# Python Reading
## Danny Castro, LMSC-261-001

### Chapter 1: The way of the program
**What I already knew:**

I already knew about functionsm operators, values and their types, and about the relevance of syntax.

**What I didnt know:**

I didnt that syntax was divided in structure and tokens. I guess in my mind I undertstood that syntax had to have the correct language in the correct order, but I did not call the correct language "tokens". I remember hearing about tokens sometime in the past. 

I also hadnt thought about reading code as parsing. It makes so much sense, it isnt always linear, and it is mostly never intuitive, so I think parsing through my code will make my life easier when debugging. I've been thinking too human-like.
### Chapter 3: Functions
**What I already knew:**

I already knew what a function was, that it contained an argument, and that it returned a value. A function is ultimately performs a computation.

**What I didnt know:**

I didnt know that you had to summon modules to perform ceratin functions, like the mathematical module python has. I also had no idea that this is how you could define a new funtion in python, and there seem to be a lot of tests, aka creating a function object from defining a function.

### Chapter 5: Conditionals and recursion

**What I already knew:**

I knew what a boolean expression is, and also what a modulus operator is too. I also knew most of the oprtator types, just maybe not by name anymore.

**What I didnt know:**

Recusrsion is still pretty bizzar, though I now undertstand thats its only calling other functions. I also didnt know to make diagrams for recursive buttons

### Chapter 10: Lists

**What I already knew:**

I know what a list is, ive used them before. I know that they work like strings and that they can be nested within reason.

**What I didnt know:**

I was clueless and did not think it was possible organise and append so many filters inside of a list
