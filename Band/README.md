## Problems Faced

I had forgotten some of the HTML syntax carrots and their meanings, as well as the order. Luckily I was able to quickly reference [last week's lesson](https://github.com/rdwrome/261fa25/tree/main/07HTML%26CSS), especially the [HTML Cheat Sheet](https://websitesetup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HTML-CHEAT-SHEET.png), as well as the example [fake band website](https://kariestes.github.io/) give to us. 

I was able to quickly catch on to the HTML format and syntax, I think ive just been so swamped with work and so tired taht it's a little hard to remember some thigns. This is resolved by regular studying, which I failed to do this past week with HTML.

## Contributions

I think I contributed a good amount. I wrote the whole HTML index document, and formatted the entire thing. I filled in the gaps with placeholder information until Chloe and Jihae were able to send me assets (photos, bios, and a track). Alicia did the CSS file! Im very grateful for that because I do not know how to do one **yet**. This shall hopefully change by next week.

As for the rest, while I was doing the HTML index doc, they helped my making the actual content that was meant to go on the website. Chloe made the song (INCREDIBLE SUMMER ANTHEM) and gave me many photos to add, Jihye wrote the bios and band description, and Alicia ate it up with the CSS document. Eveeryone did their own thing, and at no point did it feel like anyone was lagging behind. 

Making this short in-class project went smoothly and i learn a lot from jumping in there and figuring out HTML on the go.
